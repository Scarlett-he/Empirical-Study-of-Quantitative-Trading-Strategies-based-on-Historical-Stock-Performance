The file QuantitiveTradingStrategyHSP_code.ipynb is the code I wrote for the study

In the study, I developed factors from cumulative stock returns over various historical periods, and verified their efficacy through linear regression to confirming their independence from the Fama French 5 factors

Also, I conducted regressions of individual stock returns against historical return factors to evaluate factors' impact

I created dynamic asset portfolios based on changing factor loadings and validated the investment strategy by calculating excess returns
